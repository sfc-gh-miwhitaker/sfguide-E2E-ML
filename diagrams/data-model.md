Reference Implementation: This code demonstrates production-grade architectural patterns and best practices. Review and customize security, networking, and logic for your organization's specific requirements before deployment.

## Overview
This data model captures the synthetic mortgage lending dataset generated directly in Snowflake for the demo. It includes loan identifiers, timestamps, loan type and purpose, applicant income, loan amounts, county context, and the mortgage approval response label used for downstream ML training and monitoring.
